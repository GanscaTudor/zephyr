   :name: ADALM-LSMSPG curve tracer
   :relevant-api: dac_interface adc_interface

   Trace the Ic-Vc curves of the NPN curve tracer circuit on the
   ADALM-LSMSPG shield.

Overview
********

This sample reproduces, on Zephyr, the NPN transistor curve tracer built
into the ADALM-LSMSPG shield (also shown in the no-OS ``adalm-lsmspg``
``curvetrace_example`` and the pyadi-iio
``examples/adalm-lsmspg/ad5592r_curve_tracer.py`` script). It sweeps the
2N3904's base voltage over 5 steps and, for each step, sweeps the
collector drive voltage over 50 points, measuring the resulting
collector current and voltage through the AD5592R.

The circuit, from the ADALM-LSMSPG schematic:

- AD5592R CH0 (DAC) drives the base through a 49.9 kohm resistor.
- AD5592R CH2 (DAC + ADC) drives the collector through a 49.9 ohm sense
  resistor.
- AD5592R CH1 (ADC) senses the collector voltage after the sense resistor.

Collector current is computed as the voltage drop across the sense
resistor divided by its resistance; collector voltage is read directly.
Rsense and Rbase default to the schematic values and can be changed with
:kconfig:option:`CONFIG_CURVE_TRACER_RSENSE_MOHM` and
:kconfig:option:`CONFIG_CURVE_TRACER_RBASE_OHM` (the no-OS and pyadi-iio
examples use 47 ohm / 47 kohm instead).

Requirements
************

This sample needs a board with a Feather-compatible SPI connector and the
:ref:`adi_lsmspg` shield plugged in. It has been tested on
:zephyr:board:`max32666fthr`.

The Feather SPI pins must be able to drive 3.3V logic, since the AD5592R
on this shield has no separate VLOGIC supply and its input threshold is
referenced to its 3.3V VDD.
